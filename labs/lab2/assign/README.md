# COSC 304 - Introduction to Database Systems<br>Assignment 2 - Creating tables using SQL and MySQL

This assignment practices SQL DDL. 

## Question 1 (10 marks)

Write the SQL DDL to create the following 5 tables describing airports, airplanes, passengers, and flights:

- An `Airplane` table where each airplane is identified by a field called `id` that is a string of up to 10 characters. Other attributes include `model` (string up to 20 characters), and a `manufactureDate`. (1 mark)

- An `Airport` table where each airport has an `id` of exactly 5 characters, a `name` (up to 30 characters), and is located in a `city` (up to 40 characters), a `province` (up to 20 characters), and a `country` (up to 20 characters). (1.5 marks)

- A `Flight` table where each flight is identified by **both** a `number` (exactly 5 characters) and `departDateTime` (DATETIME). Note that the flight number does not by itself identify a flight as airlines reuse flight numbers. A flight departs from one airport (`departAirport`) and arrives at another (`arriveAirport`). Besides the departure date/time, there is an expected `arrivalDateTime`, and `actualDepartDateTime` and `actualArrivalDateTime`. Each flight record also stores the airplane `id` of the plane. ***Make all foreign keys set to null on delete and cascade on update.*** (3 marks)

- A `Passenger` table where each passenger is identified by an integer `id`. Also store a `firstname` and `lastname` (both up to 30 characters) and a `birthdate`. Other attributes include `street` (50 chars), `city` (40 chars), `province` (20 chars), and `country` (20 chars). (1.5 marks)

- An `OnFlight` table that stores information about passengers on flights. Each record stores the `passengerId`, `flightNumber`, `departDateTime`, and a `seatNum` (exactly 4 characters). ***Make all foreign keys set to perform no action (generate error) on delete and cascade on update.*** (3 marks)

## Question 2 (10 marks)

Write the SQL DDL to perform the following modifications to the database created in Question 1.

### Insert (5 marks)

Insert the following records into the appropriate tables.

#### Airplane
```
('AC911','Boeing 747', '2001-01-25')
('WJ455', 'Airbus A380', '2008-11-15')
```

#### Airport 
```
('YLW','Kelowna Airport','Kelowna','British Columbia', 'Canada')
('YWG','Winnipeg Airport','Winnipeg','Manitoba', 'Canada')
```

#### Flight 
```
('AC35', 'YLW', 'YWG', 'AC911', '2022-09-14 07:00:00', '2022-09-14 15:00:00', '2022-09-14 07:05:00', '2022-09-14 15:30:00')
('WJ111', 'YWG', 'YLW', 'WJ455', '2022-09-15 10:00:00', '2022-09-15 12:00:00', '2022-09-15 09:55:00', '2022-09-14 11:49:55')
```

#### Passenger
```
(1, 'Joe', 'Smith', '1970-12-15', '1350 Springfield Road', 'Kelowna', 'British Columbia', 'Canada')
(2, 'Fred', 'Brothers', '1950-01-02', '22 Pembina Highway', 'Winnipeg', 'Manitoba', 'Canada')
```

#### OnFlight 
```
(1, 'AC35', '2022-09-14 07:00:00', '1A')
(1, 'WJ111', '2022-09-15 10:00:00', '10C')
(2, 'AC35', '2022-09-14 07:00:00', '2A')
(2, 'WJ111', '2022-09-15 10:00:00', '10D')
```

### Update (2 marks)

1. Update passenger id `1` on flight `'AC35'` on the `7 a.m.` flight on `'2022-09-14'` to be seat `'2B'` rather than the current `'1A'`.

2. Delay all flights that depart Kelowna airport by 1 hour. (advance actual departure time) Note: To add an hour to a date use the syntax `DATE_ADD(your date field, INTERVAL 1 HOUR)`.

### Delete (3 marks)

1. The Kelowna airport is destroyed! Remove it from the `Airport` table. Note the changes to the flight table due to `SET NULL` foreign key action.

2. Remove the unruly passenger `1` from flight `'WJ111'` on the `10 a.m.` flight on `'2022-09-15'`.

3. Delete all on flight records for `'Fred Brothers'`. Note: You do not have to use a subquery for this question but try if you can!

## Submission

**Submit the lab answers on Canvas as a text file or document that contains all of your SQL DDL commands or show a TA your SQL DDL commands in a help session.**
